/*
Write a template function maxn() that takes as its arguments an array of items of
typeTand an integer representing the number of elements in the array and that
returns the largest item in the array.Test it in a program that uses the function template 
with an array of six intvalue and an array of four doublevalues.The program 
should also include a specialization that takes an array of pointers-to-charas
an argument and the number of pointers as a second argument and that returns the
address of the longest string.If multiple strings are tied for having the longest
length,the function should return the address of the first one tied for longest.Test
the specialization with an array of five string pointers.
